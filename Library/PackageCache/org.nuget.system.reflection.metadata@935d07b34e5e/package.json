  "description": "This package provides a low-level .NET (ECMA-335) metadata reader and writer. It's geared for performance and is the ideal choice for building higher-level libraries that intend to provide their own object model, such as compilers. The metadata format is defined by the ECMA-335 - Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification.\n\nThe System.Reflection.Metadata library is built-in as part of the shared framework in .NET Runtime. The package can be installed when you need to use it in other target frameworks.",
